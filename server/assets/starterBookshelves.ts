      "With a foreword by Ree Drummond, this beautiful book has 100 easier, faster, lightened-up Southern recipes, from the blogger behind the popular Add a Pinch website. A generation ago, home cooks may have had all day to prepare dinner, but most folks now want convenient, fast recipes that don’t rely on canned soups or other processed products. Here, fresh ingredients take center stage in slow cooker meals, casseroles and one-dish suppers, salads, soups, and desserts that have deep, satisfying flavors but are a cinch to make. Smart swaps like Greek yogurt for mayo in pimento cheese and cauliflower “rice” put a modern spin on these dishes. With 75 color photographs and lots of sidebars, this is the new Southern cooking handbook.",

      "A brilliant examination of our forty year obsession with the classic film trilogy—and a personal reflection on what it means to be Italian-American Forty years and one billion dollars in gross box office receipts after the initial release of The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola's masterful trilogy continues to fascinate viewers old and new. The Godfather Effect skillfully analyzes the reasons behind this ongoing global phenomenon. Packed with behind-the-scenes anecdotes from all three Godfather films, Tom Santopietro explores the historical origins of the Mob and why they thrived in America, how Italian-Americans are portrayed in the media, and how a saga of murderous gangsters captivated audiences around the globe. Laced with stories about Brando, Pacino, and Sinatra, and interwoven with a funny and poignant memoir about the author's own experiences growing up with an Italian name in an Anglo world of private schools and country clubs, The Godfather Effect is a book for film lovers, observers of American life, and Italians of all nationalities.",

      "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (commonly shortened to Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 novel written by English mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells of a girl named Alice falling through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre. Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.",
